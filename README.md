# INST-314-Project-6-Data

This repo has information collected from a survey conducted in-person and through the phone. It meant to investigate people's views on different types of feminism. This Github repo contains one .csv file with survey answers to 88 questions from 10 respondents of the survey. The survey questions asked demographic questions and respondents' opinions on the different kinds of feminism. Most questions were in Likert scale or single choice format, but age, gender, and occupation were in short answer format. This data was collected anonymously and no identifiying information was collected. This survey was done for the Project 6: Data collection and sharing (statistics in sociology) assignment in INST314.

Here are the three types of feminism participants were asked to think about: 

(1) Difference-denying feminism: In this approach, any difference between men and women is denied, and is said to be purely due to cultural impositions. There is no biological (called "essential") difference (no "on average" difference when doing group-wise comparison) between men and women. Every difference is socially constructed.

(2) Difference-removing feminism: There are biological difference between men and women, but these differences are burdens to women, like a curse of nature, and women must rely on technology to completely remove any biological difference between men and women to be "liberated" (for example only if we remove our wombs we can). Removing the difference is the only way of liberation. This type of feminism relies heavily on technology (especially biological technologies) for "liberation".

(3) Difference-honoring feminism: This approach does accept that there exist differences that are purely culturally-imposed and not "essential", but holds that in addition to those, there exist genuine essential differences, and denying or removing them harms women. Denying or harming differences harms everybody, not just women. Men and women have differences and they're both ok. What must change is the culture that values only masculine traits, and views feminine traits as unimportant and without value.
